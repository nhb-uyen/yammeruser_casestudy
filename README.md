# Main learning components

* Basic SQL syntax
* SQL aggregate functions
* Joining tables
* Writing subqueries
* Pivoting data in SQL

# How to access the data

You must use **Mode's coding platform** to get access to the data from their cloud data warehouse. The data I used are all pulled from the data warehouse embedded on Mode's website.

The data used in this repository are:

**tutorial.yammer_events
tutorial.yammer_user
tutorial.yammer_emails**

# Visualizations
The tables in this repository are created automatically on the Mode's code editing platform. Tables and charts are created by first running the code to produce items that can then be drag and drop into the table frame.
